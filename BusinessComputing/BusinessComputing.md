# Business Computing

## Why programming?

- Analytics defined (Oxford)
    - The systematic computational analysis of data or statistics
    - Information resulting from the systematic analysis of data or statistics
- Computers are the only way to handle all the data
- Off-the-shelf software can be limiting

## Objectives

1. Define what is meant by an information system
2. Define and describe algorithms
3. Describe information processing
4. Examine the structure of an information system
5. Describe how an application is made

## An Information System

- A set of interrelated components that collect, process, store, and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization
- This includes analysis and visualization
- Analytics applications are a subset of Information Systems Applications

## Building an Information System

- We will focus on a broad set of interrelated ideas
- Two fundamental ideas are algorithms and information processing
