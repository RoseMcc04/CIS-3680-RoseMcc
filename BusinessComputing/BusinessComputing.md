# Business Computing

## Why programming?

- Analytics defined (Oxford)
    - The systematic computational analysis of data or statistics
    - Information resulting from the systematic analysis of data or statistics
- Computers are the only way to handle all the data
- Off-the-shelf software can be limiting

## Objectives

1. Define what is meant by an information system
2. Define and describe algorithms
3. Describe information processing
4. Examine the structure of an information system
5. Describe how an application is made

## An Information System

- A set of interrelated components that collect, process, store, and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization
- This includes analysis and visualization
- Analytics applications are a subset of Information Systems Applications

## Building an Information System

- We will focus on a broad set of interrelated ideas
- Two fundamental ideas are algorithms and information processing

## Algorithms

- A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer
- Features of an algorithm:
    - Consists of a finite number of instructions
    - Each individual instruction is well defined
        - Action described by the instruction can be performed effectivelty or be executed by a computing agent
    - Eventually stops after arriving at a solution to a problem
    - Solves a general class of problems
- Examples: Baking a cake, Changing a tire, Math operations
