## Dictionaries

- A dictionary organizes information by **association**, not position
    - *Example: When you use a dictionary to look up the definition of a word, you do not start on the first page, you turn to the words with the query you desire*
- Data structures organized by association are also called **tables**, **association lists**, or **mappings**
- In Python, a **dictionary** associates a **key** with a data value

## Dictionary Literals

- A Python dictionary is written as a sequence of key/value pairs separated by commas
    - Pairs are called **entries**
    - Enclosed in curly braces `{}`
    - A colon `:` separates a key and its value
    - A comma `,` separates entries
- Examples:
    - A phone book: `{'Savannah':'476-3321', 'Nathaniel':'351-7743'}`
    - Personal information: `{'Name':'Molly', 'Age':'18'}`
    - An empty dictionary: `{}`
- Keys in a dictionary can be data of any immutable types, including other data structures
    - They are normally strings or integers
