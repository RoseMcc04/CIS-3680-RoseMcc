## Objectives

- Understand how to read text files
- Understand how to write text files
- Discuss file operations

## Motivation

- A place to save your strings
    - Long-term storage
    - Transport

## Text Files

- A text file is a software object that stores data on a permanent medium such as a disk or thumbdrive
- When compared to keyboard input from a human user, the main advantages of taking input data from a file are:
    - The dataset can be much larger
    - The data can accept input much quicker and with less chance of error
    - The data can be used repeatedly with the same program or different programs

### Format of Text Files

- Using a text editor such as *Notepad* or *TextEdit*, you can create, view, and save data in a text file
- A text file containing six floating-point numbers might look like:
```text
34.6 22.33 66.75
77.12 21.44 99.01
```
- All data output to or input from a text file must be <ins>strings</ins>
    - Number must be converted to string before output
