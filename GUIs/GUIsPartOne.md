## Objectives

- Design and code a GUI-based program 
- Define a new class using subclassing and inheritance 
- Instantiate and lay out different types of window objects, such as labels, entry fields, and command buttons in a window's frame 
- Define methods that handle events associated with window objects

## Introduction

- Most modern computer software employs a **graphical user intergface (GUI)**
- A GUI displays text as well as small images (called icons) that represent objects such as directories, files of different types, command buttons, and drop-down menus 
- In addition to entering text at a keyboard, the user of a GUI can select an icon with a pointing device, such as a mouse, and move that icon around on the display 

## Terminal-Based Programs vs. GUI-Based Programs

- Two different versions of the same program from a user's perspective:
    - Terminal-based interface 
    - Graphical user interface 
- Both programs perform exactly the same function 
    - However, their behavior, or look and feel, from a user's perspective are quite different 

### *Terminal-Based Example*

- Terminal-based user interface has several effects on its users: 
    - User is constrained to a definite sequence of prompts for inputs 
        - Once an input is entered, there is no way of changing it  
    - To obtain results for a different set of input data, the user must wait forf the command menu to be displayed again 
        - At that point, the same command and all of the other inputs must be re-entered

### *GUI-Based Example*

- GUI-based version displays a window that contains various components 
    - Called **window objects** or **widgets**
- GUI-based version has the following effects on users:
    - User is not constrained to enter inputs in a particular order  
        - Before pressing the Compute button, the user an edit any of the data 
    - Running different data sets does not require re-entering all of the data 
- GUIs seem to be a definite improvement over the terminal-based user interfaces
