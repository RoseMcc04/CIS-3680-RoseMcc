## Variable Association

- A variable associates a name with an object
- Makes it easier to remember and use later in the program
- Variables serve two purposes:
    - Help the programmer keep track of data that changes over time
    - Allow the programmer to refer to a complex piece of information with a simple name (called abstraction)
- Variables receive initial values and can be reset to new values with an **assignment statement**
    - <**variable name**> = <**expression**>
    - Subsequent uses of the variable name in expressions are known as **variable references**

## Naming Variables

- Variable naming rules
    - Reserved words <ins>cannot</ins> be used as variable names
        - Examples: **print**, **if**, **def**, and **import**
- Name must begin with a letter or _
- Name can contain any numbers of letters, digits, or _
- Names are case sensitive
    - Example: **WEIGHT**, **weight**, and **Weight** are all different names  

- Start variable names with **lowercase letters**
- Use an underscore to separate words in a name to improve readability
    - *Example: **interest_rate***
- Programmers use all uppercase letters for **symbolic constants** (contain values that the program never changes)
    - *Examples: **TAX_RATE** and **STANDARD_DEDUCTION***
