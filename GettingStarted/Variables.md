## Variable Association

- A variable associates a name with an object
- Makes it easier to remember and use later in the program
- Variables serve two purposes:
    - Help the programmer keep track of data that changes over time
    - Allow the programmer to refer to a complex piece of information with a simple name (called abstraction)
- Variables receive initial values and can be reset to new values with an **assignment statement**
    - <**variable name**> = <**expression**>
    - Subsequent uses of the variable name in expressions are known as **variable references**
