## Objectives 

- Develop recursive algorithms to draw recursive shapes
- Write a nested loop to process a two-dimensional grid
- Develop algorithms to perform simple transformations of images, such as conversion of color to grayscale

## Image Processing 

- Digital image processing includes the principles and techniques for the following:
    - The capture of images with devices such as flatbed scanners and digital cameras 
    - The representation and storage of images in efficient file formats 
    - Constructing the algorithms in image-manipulation programs such as *Adobe Photoshop*
