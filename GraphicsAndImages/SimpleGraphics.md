## Objectives

- Use the concepts of object-oriented programming - classes, objects, and methods - to solve a problem
- Develop algorithms that use simple graphics operations to draw two-dimensional shapes
- Use the RGB system to create colors in graphics applications and modify pixels in images

## Simple Graphics

- **Graphics**
    - Discipline that underlies the representation and display of geometric shapes in two-and-three-dimensional space
- **Turtle graphics**
    - Toolkit that provides a simple and enjoyable way to draw pictures in a window
    - **turtle** is a non-standard, open-source Python module

## Overview of Turtle Graphics

- Turtle graphics originally developed as part of the children's programming language, **Logo**
    - *Created by Seymour Papert and his colleagues at MIT in the late 1960s*
- Analogy: Turtle crawling on a piece of paper, with a pen tied to its tail
    - Sheet of paper is a window on a display screen
    - Position specified with **(x, y)** coordinates
        - Cartesian **coordinate system**, with origin (0, 0) at the center of the window
