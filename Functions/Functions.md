## Objectives

- Discuss the use of functions
- Explain how to define a function
- Examine several uses of functions

## Overview of Functions

- A function packages an algorithm into a chunk of code that you can call by a function name
- A function can be called from anywhere in a program's code, including code within other functions
- A function can receive data from its caller called arguments
- When a function is called, any expression supplied as arguments are first evaluated
- A function may have one or more **return** statements

## Improved Code with Functions

- Eliminate redundant, or repetitious, code
- Serve as Abstraction Mechanisms
    - Hides detail - Allows a person to view many things as just one thing
    - A function call expresses the idea of a process to the programmer
- Allows us to organize our code more effectively
- Make code reusable
